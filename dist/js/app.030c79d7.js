Surprisingly, however, the adversaries that are the hardest to conquer are the smallest. Bacteria, viruses, and other micro-organisms have proven insanely challenging to figure out, so humans have been dying of disease forever. Over time, we have gotten better at figuring out certain properties of these organisms, but we are far from the complete picture. In this virtual exhibit, I will be exploring how our understanding of viruses and other disease-causing micro-organisms has changed over time. Specifically, I’ll look at three distinct periods in time when circumstances were right for a pandemic to hit: the 1300s European “Black Death,” the 1918 Influenza Epidemic, and the COVID-19 Pandemic. The earliest of these periods represents a time in human history when our understanding of what caused viruses was limited due to a lack of sufficiently advanced technology. The second represents a time when we had slightly more advanced technology but was still before the invention of vaccines and the Digital Revolution. Finally, COVID-19 will represent modern society as we all know it, considering it’s happening now, which is the ever-rising peak of human knowledge and a point at which we thought we had conquered viruses. In the exhibit, I will inquire what the different societies did well and what they didn’t do well. Hopefully in analyzing these different responses, we can get an idea of whether or not we are prepared for another pandemic and, if not, what we can do to get ready. The exhibit is in the form of a timeline. The major artifacts get their own image and summary; it also has some contextual information and events, which will help us understand the humans general level of knowledge over time.",items:[{id:"c1",date:1346,isContextual:!0,title:"Black Death plague hits Europe."},{id:"e1",date:1480,isContextual:!1,title:"Edward IV's Plague Medicines published.",imgSrc:"https://spartacus-educational.com/00blackdeath1.jpg",desc:"One of the known accounts of medicinal practices used to treat the sick during the plague, Edward IV shows just how little people knew about medicine and viruses at the time. The quote I found in the archive I used detailed the process recommended for treating the disease: \"A medicine for the plague... Take an egg that is newly laid, and make a hole in either end, and blow out all that is within. And lay it to the fire and let it roast till it may be ground to powder, but do not burn it. Then take a quantity of good treacle, and mix it with chives and good ale. And then make the sick drink it for three evenings and three mornings.\" This shows us that even though society wasn't new, people and medical professionals still didn't know that much about how viruses or the body works."},{id:"c2",date:1660,isContextual:!0,title:"Newton invents calculus while quarantined."},{id:"e3",date:1918,isContextual:!1,title:"LA calls to quarantine over influenza epidemic.",imgSrc:"https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cache/1/2/8/1280flu.0013.821/00000001.tif100.gif",desc:"This source shows the point when the 1918 Influenza virus was no longer controllable.

This masked society may be the new normal, as even with vaccinations the spread could remain uncontrollable. Humans know now more than ever how viruses work, so the unfortunate circumstance was probably entirely avoidable.
